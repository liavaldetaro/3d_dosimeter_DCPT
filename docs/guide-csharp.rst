C# for dosimetry: General notes
***************************

Creating scripts that interact with the program Eclipse can lighten the burden when dealing with a large amount of data.

.. highlight:: html

The literal blocks are now highlighted as HTML, until a new directive is found.

::
   <html><head></head>
   <body>This is a text.</body>
   </html>

The following directive changes the hightlight language to SQL.

.. highlight:: sql

::
   SELECT * FROM mytable

.. highlight:: none

From here on no highlighting will be done.

::
   SELECT * FROM mytable

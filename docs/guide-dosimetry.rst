Electromagnetic interactions
-----------------------------

We can characterize the interaction between protons and atomic electrons as a function
of the classical impact parameter, b (the closest distance between the initial trajectory 
of the incident particle and the nucleus), and a (the atomic radius).
  - b>>a: 
          Incident proton interacts with the atom as a whole, only transfering a small 
          amount of energy
  - bâ‰ˆa: 
          incident proton can interact with a single atomic electron, tranfering a large
          amount of energy, resulting in "knock-on electrons" or :math:`\gamma`-rays. The 
          collisions can be approximated by the Rutherford cross section (for non-relativistic
          energies) or the Bahha cross section (for relativistic energies), as the electron 
          binding energy is usually much small than the transferred.
  -b<<a:
          Incident proton can interact electromagnetically with the nucleus via elastic and inelastic           coulomb interactions. These result in large angular deflection for the proton, given its 
          much smaller radius when compared to the nucleus.
Because the interactions are stochastic in nature, we will often discuss mean values - averaged over many particles. One important quantity for radiation therapy is the *stopping power*, representing the mean energy loss per unit of path length. Individual p

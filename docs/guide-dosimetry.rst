Interactions with matter
========================

-----------------------------
Electromagnetic interactions
-----------------------------

We can characterize the interaction between protons and atomic electrons as a function
of the classical impact parameter, b (the closest distance between the initial trajectory 
of the incident particle and the nucleus), and a (the atomic radius).
  - b>>a: 
          Incident proton interacts with the atom as a whole, only transfering a small 
          amount of energy
  - bâ‰ˆa: 
          incident proton can interact with a single atomic electron, tranfering a large
          amount of energy, resulting in "knock-on electrons" or :math:`\gamma`-rays. The 
          collisions can be approximated by the Rutherford cross section (for non-relativistic
          energies) or the Bahha cross section (for relativistic energies), as the electron 
          binding energy is usually much small than the transferred.
  - b<<a:
          Incident proton can interact electromagnetically with the nucleus via elastic and inelastic           coulomb interactions. These result in large angular deflection for the proton, given its 
          much smaller radius when compared to the nucleus.
Because the interactions are stochastic in nature, we will often discuss mean values - averaged over many particles. One important quantity for radiation therapy is the **stopping power**, representing the mean energy loss per unit of path length. Individual particle trajectories (and energy loss) can deviate widely from the mean, so the beam undergoes **energy straggling**, resulting in a gradual broadening of the energy spectrum with penetration depth. **Scattering power** is the mean angular deflection per unit of path length.

---------------------------------
Strong-force nuclear interactions
---------------------------------

We can characterze strong-force interactions as:
    - Inelastic: 
                Kinectic energy is not conserved, but target nucleus remains unchanged; remaining
                after the interaction and/or emiting a :math:`\gamma`-ray. It can be treated in a
                similar manner to inelastic coulomb interactions (in a sense that the incident 
                proton continues to be transported and :math:`\gamma`-rays can be emitted).
    - Non-elastic:
                Kinetic energy is not conserved and the target nucleus undergoes break-up and/or
                a particle transfer reaction occurs. This interaction results in attenuation, as
                protons are removed from the incident beam by absorption or projectile
                fragmentation.
If the projectile (resulting from non-elastic collisions) is absorbed, its nucleons penetrate the nucleus, leading to a intranuclear cascade. This results to the ejection of forward-directed protons, neutrons, and/or even pions (if the projectile's kinetic energy is high enough for its formation). The residual energy that is not carried away is distributed through the nucleus (precompound --> compound state), and any further emission is isotropic. The compound nucleus loses energy via evaporation of protons, neutrons, light fragments (mainly :math:`\alpha` particles) and :math:`\gamma`-ray emission, until a stable nucleus is reached.

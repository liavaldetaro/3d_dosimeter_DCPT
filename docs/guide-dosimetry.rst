Interactions with matter

Electromagnetic interactions
-----------------------------

We can characterize the interaction between protons and atomic electrons as a function
of the classical impact parameter, b (the closest distance between the initial trajectory 
of the incident particle and the nucleus), and a (the atomic radius).
  - b>>a: incident proton interacts with the atom as a whole, only transfering a small 
          amount of energy
  - bâ‰ˆa: incident proton can interact with a single atomic electron, tranfering a large
          amount of energy, resulting in "knock-on electrons" or :math:`\delta`-rays

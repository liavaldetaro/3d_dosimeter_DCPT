To clone the repository to your local system, open a terminal window, create a directory and type:
git clone https://github.com/liavaldetaro/3d_dosimeter.git

You can modify/create files directly in Github, but it is possible to do so from your local system and commit the changes from terminal, take a look at:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Github is structured so that there is a main branch called 'MASTER' that is the up to date version of the source code. For safety, never update directly to it. You can create a branch out of 'MASTER' by selecting the option 'create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request'. This allows you to test out the changes without changing the main file.

The website is hosted by Read the Docs. You can recompile after modifying files to see the changes:
